      <h2>Luther Richardson</h2>
        <p>I'm finishing my MS in software development at Boston University this summer somewhere in the garden state. 
          <p>Previously, I worked as a Product Manager at Radius Bank and LendingClub over 5+ years. I led Rewards Checking, 
           cash back, banking as a service platforms, and app/online banking.</p> 
        <p>Outside work I'm busy practicing photography, eating my way through the city, or traveling somewhere new.</p>
